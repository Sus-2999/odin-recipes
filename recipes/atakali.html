        <li>Stop stirring when you obtain a thick dough. Turn off the flame and allow the dough to cool down.</li>
        <li>After the dough is cooled enough, make little balls of the dough.</li>
        <li>Add just enough water to the remaining rice powder so that a rice paste is formed.</li>
        <li>Take six cups of water in another container and heat it on medium flame.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, salt and remaining scraped coconut to the boiling water and stir it continuously to form syrup.</li>
        <li>Little by little, add the rice paste to the boiling syrup and continue stirring.</li>
        <li>Then add the dough balls into the syrup and stir the contents for 30 seconds on low flame.</li>
        <li>Turn off the flame. Let the contents cool down.</li>
