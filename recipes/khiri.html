    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
        Khiri, commonly known as <i>Kheer</i> in different regions of India, is a popular Indian dessert. In Odisha, it is made in a slightly different way.
        Khiri is associated with the famous Jagannath temple of Puri, where it had been served to the deities as prasad for centuries together. It's an
        indicator that Khiri existed in Odisha since the time the Jagannath temple was built in the 12th century.
