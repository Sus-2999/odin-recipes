    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
        Rasagola, also known as rasgulla, rosogola or rosogolla, is a syrupy dessert popular in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal and Odisha. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings
        of <strong>chhena</strong> and semolina dough, cooked in light sugar syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.<br/>
        <strong>Chhena</strong> or <i>chhana</i> (Bengali pronunciation) are a style of cheese, originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from water buffalo or regular cow milk
        by adding food acids such as lemon juice and calcium lactate instead of rennet, and, straining the whey through filtration.<br/>

    <p>
        <b>FUN FACT:</b> West Bengal and Odisha have disputed with each other over the origins of Rasagola for many years. As of 2019, the dispute got settled as the Government of India
        granted <em>Geographical Indication status</em> to the regional variants of the Rasagola - <strong>Banglar Rosogolla</strong> and <strong>Odia Rasagola</strong>.
